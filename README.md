# Turbin3 Solana Dev Journey

This repository documents my journey through the **Turbin3 Solana Developer Program**, showcasing Rust fundamentals and upcoming Solana blockchain projects.

## Current Projects

| Project       | Description                                      | Focus Areas                     |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **RNG Game**  | A console-based number guessing game in Rust using the `rand` crate. | Randomness, input validation, loops, error handling |
| **minigrep**  | A lightweight CLI search tool inspired by `grep` for pattern matching in files. | File I/O, iterators, environment variables, error handling |
| **Multi-threaded Web Server** | HTTP web server with custom thread pool implementation for concurrent request handling. | Concurrency, thread pools, networking, graceful shutdown |
| **hello-anchor** | First Solana program built with the Anchor framework. | Solana program development, Anchor framework, blockchain |
| **rustlings**  | Rust exercises for learning core concepts through hands-on practice. | Rust fundamentals, ownership, traits, error handling |

## Focus Areas

- **Rust Core**: Ownership, borrowing, Cargo workflows, error handling, iterators  
- **Control Flow**: Loops, conditionals, pattern matching  
- **Concurrency**: Multi-threading, thread pools, channels, Arc/Mutex  
- **Systems Programming**: File I/O, networking, HTTP servers, CLI tools  
- **Crates & Logic**: `rand` for randomness, environment variables, std library  
- **Solana Development**:  
  - Program structure & entrypoints  
  - Accounts, PDAs, CPI  
  - Anchor framework basics
